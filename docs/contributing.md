- State Space
  - [ ] Handle quaternions and their derivatives (velocity mapping)
  - [ ] The proper Jacobians with quaternions in the state (tangent bundle)
  - [ ] The discrete state space (integrator)
  - [ ] Implement Hamiltonian State Space i.e `state = [position, momentum]`
- Modeling Backends
  - [ ] Refactor the model class, add folder with backends
  - [ ] Implement or use some ready implementation `rnea, crba, regressor, forward_kinematics` with JAX/PyTorch 
  - [ ] Pure pinocchio backend and 'all-in-one' update  
- Constrained and Contact Dynamics
  - [ ] Features to create closed loops with holonomic/nonholonomic constraints (Lagrangian/Udwadia-Kalaba)
  - [ ] The minimal coordinates representation

  - [ ] Physical consistancy constraints and conversion to pseudo inertia (4x4) matrix and back.
  - [ ] Implement all dynamical attributes with auxilary `parameter` input
  - [ ] `Regressors` class
- General:
  - [ ] Add number of bodies `nb` and their names to model attributes.  
  - [ ] Setting free-flyer joints (to prevent locking floating body to ground)
  - [ ] Locking joints feature to facilitate reduced models (i.e. saggital models of bipeds)
  - [ ] Configuration difference functions
  - [ ] Code generation and just in time compilation
  - [ ] Prepare docs and proper examples for each aspect of the library
