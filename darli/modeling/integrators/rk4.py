    Implements the Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4) method.

    This implementation of RK4 is capable of handling systems that evolve not just in
    Euclidean space but also on manifolds. This is particularly useful for
    models that include rotational dynamics, where the state variables (such as
    quaternions) evolve on a manifold.

        Initialize the RK4 integrator with a model that defines system dynamics,
