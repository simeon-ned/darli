This submodule provides implementation of various numerical integrators that are
designed to respect the manifold structure of configuration spaces, such as the
space of quaternions for representing orientations in 3D.

The key concept in these integrators is the use of tangent space (logarithm map)
for computations during each integration step. The results are then mapped back onto the
manifold using the exponential map, ensuring that the updated configurations remain
within the manifold.
