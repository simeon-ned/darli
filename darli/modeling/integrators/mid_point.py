class MidPoint(Integrator):
    """
    Implements the Midpoint method for numerical integration.

    The Midpoint method is a second-order method that computes the derivative
    at the midpoint of the interval to update the state. It provides a better
    approximation than the Euler method with modest computational requirements.
    This method can handle systems with state spaces that include manifolds.
