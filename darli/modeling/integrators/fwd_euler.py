    Implements the Euler method for numerical integration.

    The Euler method is a simple first-order integration method that updates
    the state by taking a single step forward using the derivative of the
    state at the current position. This method can be used for systems
    evolving on manifolds and is computationally less intensive than higher-order methods.
